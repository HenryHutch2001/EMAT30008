    "**Eulers Method**: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: Initially there are some validation checks to determine whether the inputs provided are of the right class or make logical sense (e.g t2 < t1), then the time domain is divided into points, where $ t(i+1)-t(i) = \\Delta h $. Once these variables are assigned, the initial guess 'x0' is added to an array used to store solutions; the array is used in a for loop that iterates the same number of times as there are values in the time discretised time domain. This loop uses the currently indexed solution to determine a value for the next time step using the step function, this value is then added to the array using 'vstack' to allow for an arbitrary number of dimensions. The function then returns the array of time values, and their corresponding solutions. \n",

    "**Discussion**: Demonstrated by the plot above, the function provides an accurate approximation to the true solution provided the step size 'h' is small enough. As h increases, the accuracy of the approximation decreases significantly. To combat this issue i implemented a value error check that raises an error when the step size is larger than a specific value i'd deemed to be a good enough approximation. The error of Eulers Method is proportional to the $ \\Delta h^2 $ , so by setting the maximum limit to 0.1, I ensured the user with an error proportional to 0.01. The following design choices were made to maximise the functionality of the code whilst making it easy to understand: \n",
    "Clear documentation describes the functions inputs, outputs and functionality making it's use easy for users to use the function. The function checks the validity of inputs, such as ensuring that the initial conditions are provided as a list, the time values are positive and in the correct order, and the step size is not too large. The function uses the euler_step function to solve a single step of the ODE, promoting modularity and reusability of code. The function makes use of numpy arrays to store and manipulate data, which allows for efficient computation and faster execution. The function returns a tuple of two arrays, representing the time values and the approximated values of the ODE, respectively. This makes it easier for users to plot or analyze the data.\n",

To improve the function further, i'd like to have implemented more rigorous tests for run time and computational complexity, but these are highly subjective dependent on various factors such as dimensionality and step size, and I believe that the approach considered and implemented along with the commands used suffice.\n",

Even at a step size ten times larger than the one used in the Eulers approximation, RK4 demonstrates almost an exact approximation to the true solution. I implemented the same checks used in the afformentioned method, but increased the step size threshold. The RK method is computationally more expensive than Eulers method, therefore at equivalent step sizes the runtime of RK4 is greater than Eulers method; by increasing the step size threshold it decreased the number of iterations the method completes, thus decreasing runtime.\n",

This is due to the error for RK4 being proportional to $ \\Delta h^5 $, thus the rate at which error decreases with step size is much faster. The same design choices were implemented into the development of the RK4 method. The equivalent design choices are exhibited in this function as they are in the Eulers Method function.\n",

The root function uses the previous guess as an initial guess for the root finding, the solutions are then appended to an array along with the corresponding parameter value, dependent on the solutions '.success' attribute. The Pseudo Arc-length function uses the first two values obtained from the natural parameter continuation function as the two known solutions. It then uses various numpy functions to perform the necessary calculations used to determine the variables needed for the method. These variables are then passed to a subfunction which formulates the Pseudo arc-length equations as a system, for which scipys 'root' function solves. These solutions are then appended to an array dependent on their success. This function makes use of a while loop to determine the solutions within the parameter range. After these two methods' definitions, the function passes each input through some value checks to ensure viable inputs are passed to the function."

Although the methods both work, the Pseudo function could definitely have been written more concisely. I struggled to formulate a more efficient way of writing this function but was just happy to see it working correctly. Although continuation works for this particular example, it's success is very dependent on the initial guess provided by the user which I can imagine would lead to a lot of misleading solutions if this value was wrong initially.

It's constrained to only one independent variable and one variable parameter, and each solution is highly dependent on the initial guess provided by the user. As mentioned before, the Pseudo Arc-length subfunction could've been written in a more concise manner, and used more generalised functions to account for equations with more dimensions. I did struggle a lot with the development of these functions, my knowledge of bifurcation diagrams is stronger than most of the areas my functions were developed for, so this did surprise me.\n",

    "I struggled when it came to systems with more dimensions using scipys 'root', for instance the Hopf normal form's equilibria can always equal zero for each variable, no matter the parameter values, thus this was the only solution being found with my function. This led to development becoming very frustrating. It would've been very interesting to experiment with continutation on the PDE's below, and I feel like it'd have aided my understanding of their solutions which would've made writing the functions easier. Overall, I'm glad I managed to develop the function, but frustrated with the level I managed to develop it to. \n",

The 'SolveSource' function makes use of a for loop to cycle through the discretised space, updating the system at each point in the grid. The function then uses scipys 'root' to determine the solution of the system. After these subfunctions are defined, the solver runs some input checks, raising errors for any invalid inputs. The function then passes the inputs to the respective subfunction dependent on the 'bc_type' variable for which the solution is then returned along with the corresponding gridpoints."

The implementation of continuation with this function would provide useful insight into the analysis of solutions, but unfortunately my continuation function only works with one variable, thus is incompatible. The function could also benefit from some comments to aid readibility.

I then discretised both spatial and time domains using numpy's 'linspace' and 'arange' functions respectively so that i'd be able to use a nested for loop to iterate through each domain, updating the solutions at each step. Once the important variables were defined, the function initialise the solution array with zeros, and replaces the first row with any initial condition specified externally. The function then iterates through both domains, updating the solution using the relevent formulae at each step.\n",
